Getting Started
---------------

Here is a quick overview of how to get started with the Java BEEP Core
library.

BEEP Terminology
----------------

Peer - A BEEP Peer is an endpoint which acts in a intiator/client or
       listener/server role or may do both simultaneously.

Session - A BEEP Session represents a connection between two Peers

Message - A BEEP Message is request or reply interaction sent from one Peer
          to another.

Profile - A BEEP Profile defines the valid set of request-reply interactions
          between Peers.  It is a syntax for a Channel.

Channel - A BEEP Channel is the object used to send and receive Messages.
          Channels have an associated Profile that is specified when the
	  Channel is started.  Many Channels may exists within a single
	   Session.

BEEP basics
-----------

In BEEP there are two roles for all interactions: initiator and
listener. BEEP is peer-to-peer in the sense that either peer/endpoint
may assume either role at any time. For example peer 'A' initiates a
session with peer 'B' who was listening for a session. Then peer 'B'
may initiate a start channel with peer 'B'. Once the channel is
started, depending on the profile, peer 'A' could initiate a request
to peer 'B' on the channel that 'B' initiated.

BEEP uses a request-reply model for sending messages. Requests are
messages of type MSG and replies are messages of type RPY, ERR, or
ANS/NUL. For each request there must be a reply.

Starting a Session
------------------

The starting point for working with BEEP is Session. Session is an
abstract class so you have to get an instance of a transport specific
session (e.g. TCPSession). From an initiator's role you can start a
Session using:

  Session session = AutomatedTCPSessionCreator.initiate(host, port,
                                                        new ProfileRegistry());

From a listener's role you can listen for new Sessions using:

  while (true) {
      AutomatedTCPSessionCreator.listen(port, profileReg);
  }

The ProfileRegistry specified in both of these examples contains the
list of profiles advertised to the other peer when the Session is
started. This is used by the peer to determine which profiles it may
specify when starting a Channel.

Registering a Profile
---------------------

To act in the listener role for a profile the application must
implement the StartChannelListener interface and register it with the
Session. This is done by adding it to the ProfileRegister used in
creating the Session:

  profileReg.addStartChannelListener(ExampleProfile.URI, example);

Starting a Channel
------------------

Channel is the object used to send and receive messages. Channels have
an associated profile that is specified when the Channel is started. A
Channel is started (initiated) using:

  Channel channel = session.startChannel(profileURI);

A class may act in the listener role for start channel requests by
implementing the StartChannelListener interface and registering it
with the ProfileRegistry for the Session. The class will get called
when the Session receives a start channel request with the new Channel
object. The class can then register a class to receive and service
request messages.

Creating a message
------------------

The abstraction for the data of a message is a DataStream. Before
sending a message one of the DataStream types (StringDataStream,
ByteDataStream, etc.) must be created.

  DataStream dataStream =
      new StringDataStream("<attach endpoint=\"fred@example.com\"/>");

NOTE: BEEP has a flow control mechanism for Channels that makes it
possible to have multiple channels on one connection. The flow control
is tied into the DataStream so that as an application reads the data
it notifies Channel that more data may be received. Because of this
the application MUST either read all of the data in the received
messages or call close on the DataStreams for the messages to allow
more data to be sent on the Channel. If this is not done the Channel
will stall once the window for the Channel is full and no more
messages will be received on that Channel.

Sending a Request
-----------------

A request is sent using the Channel:

  channel.sendMSG(dataStream, reply);

Since every BEEP request must have a reply the second parameter is a
class, implementing the ReplyListener interface, that is called when
the reply is received. The class Reply implements the ReplyListener
interface and is provided as a generic implementation.
NullReplyListener also implements the ReplyListener interface but it
discards all replies for applications that don't care about them.

Sending a Reply
---------------

A reply must be sent for each request. This may be a RPY, ERR, or an
ANS/NUL set. They are sent using the coresponding methods on Channel
(sendRPY, etc.).

ANS messages are a mechanism for sending multiple messages as a reply
to a request. A NUL message is used to mark the end of the set of ANS
messages.

Receiving a Request
-------------------

To receive requests an applications implements the MessageListener
interface and registers the class with the Channel (usually in the
startChannel callback in StartChannelListener).

  channel.setDataListener(this);

Basic Server
------------

(see example Beepd)

  ProfileRegistry reg = new ProfileRegistry();
  EchoProfile echo = new EchoProfile();

  echo.init(profileConfig);
  reg.addStartChannelListener(echo.getURI(),
                              echo.getStartChannelListener());
  while (true) {
      AutomatedTCPSessionCreator.listen(port, reg);
  }

Basic Profile
-------------

(see EchoProfile)

  public void receiveMSG(Message message) throws BEEPError
  {
      Log.logEntry(Log.SEV_DEBUG, "Received MSG Callback [ECHO]");

      try {
          message.getChannel().sendRPY(message.getDataStream());
      } catch (BEEPException e) {
          throw new BEEPError(BEEPError.CODE_REQUESTED_ACTION_ABORTED,
                              "Error sending RPY");
      }
  }

Basic Client
------------

(see example Bing)

  Session session = AutomatedTCPSessionCreator.initiate(host, port,
                                                        new ProfileRegistry());
  Channel channel = session.startChannel(EchoProfile.ECHO_URI);

  Reply reply = new Reply();
  channel.sendMSG(new StringDataStream("Hello"), reply);

  DataStream ds = reply.getNextReply().getDataStream();
  InputStream is = ds.getInputStream();

  int replyLength = 0;
  while (ds.isComplete() == false || is.available() > 0) {
      is.read();
      ++replyLength;
  }
